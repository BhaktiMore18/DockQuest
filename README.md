# 🐳 DockQuest 

> _“Every image has a story. But this one begins with a riddle.”_

Welcome to **DockQuest Challenge: The Build Sequence**, a lightweight and beginner-friendly Docker experience where you’ll learn by doing, exploring, and piecing things together.

This isn’t a complicated puzzle. There are no traps or advanced exploits.  
It’s a **gentle introduction** to the world of Docker.... with a small twist.

---

## 👩‍💻 Who's This For?

This is made for:
- Beginners just getting started with Docker
- Curious minds who enjoy learning by doing
- Anyone comfortable with basic Linux commands (`cd`, `ls`, `mv`, etc.)

> If you have some basic Docker or Linux knowledge, you’ll move faster. But total beginners are welcome too.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Install Docker

Ensure Docker is installed:

```bash
docker --version
```

If not installed, follow the official instructions for your platform:

  - [Docker Engine (Linux)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  - [Docker Desktop for macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)    


> 💡 **Note for Windows Users:**  
> To run Docker and this challenge, you **must install Docker Desktop** with **WSL2 enabled**.  
> Docker Desktop handles the Linux environment needed for Docker to work on Windows.  
> 
> Learn more and install here:  
> - [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)  
> - [Enable WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)


### 2️⃣ Clone This Repository

This repo contains the scripts you’ll need to get going:

## 🎯 What’s Inside?
We won’t spoil it.

No walkthroughs. No hints.
Just you, your terminal, and a little bit of Docker.

If you make it to the end, something special is waiting for you.

Yes!! there’s a flag, but only if you earn it.

## 💬 Final Words

“You don’t run the container. You become the container.”

Every command gets you closer.  
Think, explore, try, that’s all it takes.

**The flag is yours to find. Good luck!**
